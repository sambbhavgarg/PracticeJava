ACO is a genetic algorithm inspired by an antâ€™s natural behavior. To fully understand the ACO algorithm, we need to get familiar with its basic concepts:

ants use pheromones to find the shortest path between home and food source
pheromones evaporate quickly
ants prefer to use shorter paths with denser pheromone

c: original number of trails, at the start of the simulation
alpha: controls the pheromone importance
beta: controls the distance priority; beta>alpha for better results
evaporation: percent how much the pheromone is evaporating in every iteration
Q: information about the total amount of pheromone left on the trail by each Ant
antFactor: no. of ants used per city
randomFactor: 

## Ant.java

-visitCity(int currentIndex, int city): ability to visit a specific city
-visited(int i): remember visited cities
-trailLength(double graph[][]): keep track of the trail length
