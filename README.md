# PracticeJava

Hello!
Welcome to PracticeJava (observe the clever capitalization!), here you may find code relevant to the Java programming language you study during your high school or undergraduate studies. I hope find what you're looking for when it comes to fundamental Java. 

I try my best to keep this repository up to date and cover as much as I can on a daily basis - there's more to learn every day! I made this repository to make it a habit for myself to create a well organized folder for projects I might take up in the future. 

Feel free to make any pull requests if you feel there is a scope of any enhancement or optimization.

Happy Coding!
